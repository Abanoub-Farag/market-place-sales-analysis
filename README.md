# Online Sales Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project is an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** aiming to extract insights from a popular online marketplace sales dataset. **Python** was used along with data analysis and plotting libraries to clean the data, explore relationships between variables, and identify key sales trends.

## Data Source

The **"Online Sales Dataset - Popular Marketplace Data"** dataset, sourced from Kaggle, was used for this analysis.

## Libraries Used

The analysis was performed using the following standard Python libraries:

* **`pandas`**: For data manipulation and analysis.

* **`seaborn`**: For creating attractive and informative statistical visualizations.

* **`matplotlib.pyplot`**: For customizing and displaying plots.

## Key Insights and Findings

The analysis revealed several important findings regarding sales performance:

1. **Monthly Revenue:** The months with the highest total revenue were **January**, **March**, and **April**.

2. **Top Product Category:** The **Electronics** category generated the highest revenue, indicating it is the most profitable category.

3. **Regional Order Distribution:** The number of orders was observed to be equally distributed across all analyzed regions (Asia, Europe, North America).

4. **Average Revenue:** The average total revenue per transaction was approximately **$335.70**.

5. **Payment Methods:** The payment method analysis shows a detailed distribution of how transactions were completed, with each method representing a certain percentage of total orders.

6. **Best-Selling Products:** The **top 10** best-selling products were identified based on units sold.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone:** Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Data:** Download the data file (`Online Sales Data.csv`) from the Kaggle link above and place it in the project directory.

3. **Environment:** Ensure the `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib` libraries are installed.
